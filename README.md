## Install on iPhone (Recommended)

This app is a web app (no App Store needed). You can “install” it to your Home Screen like a normal app.

1. On your iPhone, open **Safari** (not Chrome).
2. Go to: **https://behzadgolparvar.github.io/Avalon/**
3. Tap the **Share** button (square with an up arrow).
4. Scroll and tap **Add to Home Screen**.
5. (Optional) Rename it to “Avalon”.
6. Tap **Add**.

You’ll now see an **Avalon** icon on your Home Screen. Launching it from there will open it like an app.

### Updating

When you update the website, the Home Screen shortcut will load the latest version automatically.  
If it looks like an old version, fully close the app and reopen it (or refresh in Safari).

## Install on Android (Optional)

1. Open **https://behzadgolparvar.github.io/Avalon/** in **Chrome**.

## Troubleshooting

- **“Add to Home Screen” is missing on iPhone:** make sure you’re using **Safari**, not an in-app browser (e.g., Slack/Instagram). Copy the link and open it directly in Safari.
- **The page looks outdated:** refresh in Safari, or fully close and reopen the Home Screen app. If needed, clear Safari website data for this site.
